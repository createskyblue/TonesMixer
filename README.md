A little tool to make sounds with the ArduboyTones library

I created this because I had no idea how to make some nice sounds. 
The default sond is "Alle meine Entchen" it is very well known in germany.

This library is needed to play any sounds:

# Controls

A: choose a tone, if chosen set duration with left/right and frequency with up/down
B: play to tones you set, if already playing stop it

Left/Right: go from tone to tone.

If you are at the left end of your "song" you can either "add Note" or "delete Last"
