A little tool to make sounds with the ArduboyTones library

I created this because I had no idea how to make some nice sounds.

This library is needed to play any sounds:

# Controls

A: choose a tone, if chosen set duration with left/right and frequency with up/down
B: play to tones you set, if already playing stop it

Left/Right: go from tone to tone.

If you are at the left end of your "song" you can either "add Note" or "delete Last"
